3D Model Structure
==================

# Road Networks

The structure of 3D models representing road networks should reflect coordinate frames, structure and naming of the [ASAM OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/) specification.
Comprehensive information on this standard can be found on the corresponding [ASAM OpenDRIVE project website](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/).
As an example, for OpenDRIVE 1.7, the required information can be obtained from the [ASAM OpenDRIVE 1.7 User Guide](https://www.asam.net/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=4422&token=e590561f3c39aa2260e5442e29e93f6693d1cccd).
