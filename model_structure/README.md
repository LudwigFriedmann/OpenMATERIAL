3D Model Structure
==================

Usage of 3D models in simulation-based development and testing of automated driving requires compliance with certain quality criteria. Scalable integration of the models within the heterogeneous applications of distributed simulation frameworks further requires usage of a common exchange format and standardization of node structures, transforms and coordinate frames. Standardization thus allows the harmonization of 3D model usage in simulation, animation and rendering, but also enables the shared use of the same models (e.g. residing in central repositories) across different applications.

Within this project, specifications for the following model categories are drafted:
* [`Road Networks`](Road_Structure.md)
* [`Vehicles`](Vehicle_Structure.md)

Proposals concerning further model categories (e.g. other traffic participants, buildings, road infrastructure, environment) will be added in the future.
