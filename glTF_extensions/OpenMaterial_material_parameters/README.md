OpenMaterial_material_parameters
================================

This is a proposal for an extension to the [Khronos Group glTF 2.0](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) specification. The goal of this extension is to provide a
physically accurate description of materials under different wavelengths.

**OpenMaterial_material_parameters**  addresses the physics of wave-matter interaction. It uses physical properties of
materials to describe their behavior for various environmental conditions. This physical material model works for different
sensors such as camera, lidar and radar. The extension allows the material model to be used by multiple sensors in parallel.

Various physical concepts are considered, such as geometrical optics for the visible spectrum (camera sensors) and uniform
theory of diffraction and physical optics for millimeter and sub-millimeter range (radar sensors). These concepts are used in
their validity region to cover the full-wave spectrum. The proposed physical concepts and their implementation are
independent of geometry.

In order to use this extension, it has to be listed in the ``extensionsUsed`` section of the corresponding asset:
```
"extensionsUsed" : [
    "OpenMaterial_material_parameters"
]
```

Properties
----------

The material properties used within the extension are defined based on the material model. This list of parameters not only
includes physical properties of the material but also allows differentiation of surface, volume and subsurface interactions. 
Physical properties of a material are stored in the same file, regardless of the type of sensor. A particular class (i.e.
WavelengthRange) defines if the material is detectable from the specific type of sensor, which is used to render the scene,
through a window of valid wavelenghth values.

The index of refraction (IOR), Poynting Vector, Snell and Fresnel laws (geometric options) and coating (interference) are the
material properties describing the surface interactions. In contrast, the mean free path, particle density, absorbtion and
particle cross section are parameters describing volume interactions.  For radar sensors, besides geometrical optics
calculations, diffraction models and possibly numerical simulations can be included in the wave-matter interaction. Surface
roughness is defined by the surface height root-mean-square (rms) and correlation length both in the unit of micrometer.
A definition of all above mentioned parameters enables usage of a material for camera, lidar and radar simulations.

Wave-matter interaction
-----------------------

Within this project, wave-matter interaction is demonstrated based on the proposed material model for the case of perfectly
smooth aluminium and gold. This demonstration considers camera sensors and implements Fresnel equations for surface
interactions in visible light.

Visible light (light) is the electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of 390 to 700 nanometers. Light interaction with material
depends on the physical properties of the material. These physical properties can be measured and are provided in physics
and chemistry literature. In the case of specular reflection, the Fresnel equations are used to describe how much of the
incident ray is reflected and refracted. The Fresnel equations satisfy the energy conservation, so the total amount of the
reflected and refracted light is equal to the incoming light. The angle of the refracted ray is given by Snell's law. Both
the Fresnel equations and Snell's law depend on the index of refraction (IOR) which is a function of temperature and
wavelength.

The index of refraction is a complex function which has a real and an imaginary part. The real part accounts for refraction,
while the imaginary part describes the light attenuation. Instead of experimental data, the index of refraction can also be
described by theoretical models such as the Lorentz oscillator model. This model provides a good description for many
materials like metals, water, polystyrene, mercury, or silicone at wavelengths typically bigger than one micrometer.


Texture based displacement
--------------------------

The surface of geometry files can be manipulated by applying distortion of the normals and vertexes position of the
meshes. This effect can be controlled by mapping displacement textures to the geometry. The former are gray-scale/
coloured pictures associating the distortion of the displacement as a function of the local coordinate u and v.
In this context, the displacement direction is the local surface normal. Brighter textures will lead to higher displacement.

Example
-------

Within its `material` section, the file describing the geometry of a 3D model has to provide a reference to a file based on the
**OpenMaterial_material_parameters** extension and therefore providing physical material parameters and the description of
the material:

```
"materials" : [  
        {  
            "name" : "aluminium",  
            "extensions": {  
                "OpenMaterial_reference_link": {  
                    "id": "a3a62d4531e64ae5a620030b1deaff7c",  
                    "title": "aluminium",  
                    "uri": "../materials/aluminium.gltf"   <======  
                }  
            }  
        }  
    ],  
```

This way, the same material can be used by different geometries (i.e. 3D models, meshes, etc.):   

```  
    "meshes": [  
        {  
            "primitives": [  
                    "indices": 0,  
                    "mode": 4,  
                    "material": 0 <======  
                }  
            ],  
            "name": "body_115"  
        },  
        {  
            "primitives": [  
                    "indices": 3,  
                    "mode": 4,  
                    "material": 0 <======  
                }  
            ],  
            "name": "body_72"  
        },  
```

The physical parameters provided in the referenced material file (e.g. `aluminium.gltf`, `iron.gltf` or `gold.gltf`) are used to
compute reflection of rays at the geometry (see above sections "Properties" and "Code structure"):
